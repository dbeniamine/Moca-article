\begin{itemize}
    \item HPC => importance of memory hierarchy / cache
    \item Automated tools can't fix everything => need good code
    \item Existing profiling tools focus on CPU because memory analysis is
        hard
    \item Memory analysis usually without time, or very focused on specific
        stuff (NUMA / Architectures).
    \item MOCA => fast, portable, precise memory trace collection
\end{itemize}
