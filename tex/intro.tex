\begin{itemize}
    \item HPC => importance of memory
        \begin{itemize}
            \item NUMA
            \item Caches
        \end{itemize}
    \item Runtimes aren't the only solution
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Overhead
            \item Only provide ``good'' page mapping
            \item Sometimes provides worts results
            \item Can't fix bad patter
        \end{itemize}
    \item  Need of memory profiling
    \item Existing tools:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Most are CPU oriented
            \item Few Memory oriented
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Show very precise informations (number of remote
                        access)
                    \item Often relies on info from CPU
                    \item No global view of the memory
                    \item No temporal informations
                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \item Getting a global view of the memory access over time is hard:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item How to collect efficiently
            \item Lot of data to store / keep on memory
            \item Times means synchronisations
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
